- 👋 Hi, I’m @AHH-BEES
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code, mainly powershell for now but SQL and other languages in the future.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning powershell and how to use it efficiently in controling my network/devices with preexisting features.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that helps me learn
- 📫 How to reach me ... HERE!! for now at least... More to come.
